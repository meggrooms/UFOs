# UFO Sightings in January 1-13, 2010


There is a title, and there are multiple paragraphs. (2 pt)

Each paragraph has a heading. (2 pt)

There are subheadings to break up text. (2 pt)

Images are formatted and displayed where appropriate. (2 pt)



## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the UFOs project is to create a dynamic webpage using user inputs to filter through UFO sighting data. Users are able to filter results by date, city, state, country, and shape.


## Results:
How to filter results:<BR>
### 1. Visit the website<BR>

### 2. Enter the parameters you'd like to search in the "Filter Search" & click return/enter.<BR><BR>

## Summary
While the webpage and filter are effective, there are a few drawbacks with the breadth of the filter.<BR>
#### Drawbacks and recommended suggestions
The filter parameters aren't as effective as they could be. As an example, the user may not know what city they want to search. <BR>
 <strong>Recommendation:</strong> In this case having a dropdown menu with available cities could be helpful. A resource to consider is W3School, specifically <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_dropdown.asp">this link.</a><BR><BR>

Users must enter all lowercase letters, resulting in inaccurate results. For instance, a search for "CA" or "California" will result in a blank search. <BR>
<strong>Recommendation:</strong> The addition of a line of code similar to the one <a href="https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/compare-strings-ignore-case">shown on this website</a>. Adding toUpperCase() or toLowerCase() can solve this issue.<BR><BR>

Further Development Recommendations<BR>
The data can be cleaned up for consistency.
