# UFO Sightings in January 1-13, 2010


## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the UFOs project is to create a dynamic webpage using user inputs to filter through UFO sighting data. Users are able to filter results by date, city, state, country, and shape. 

The purpse of this project was to:<BR>
• Build and deploy JavaScript functions, including built-in functions.<br>
• Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions.<BR>
• Build and deploy forEach (JavaScript for loop).<BR>
• Create, populate, and dynamically filter a table using JavaScript and HTML


## Results:
### How to filter results:<BR>
#### 1. Visit the website<BR>

#### 2. Enter the parameters you'd like to search in the "Filter Search" & click return/enter.<BR><BR>
In this example I've search for all UFO sightings over El Cajon, California<BR><br>

## Summary
While the webpage and filter are effective, there are a few drawbacks concerning filter functionality<BR>
 #### <ins>Drawbacks and recommended suggestions</ins>
The filter parameters aren't as effective as they could be. As an example, the user may not know what city they want to search. <BR>
 <strong>Recommendation:</strong> In this case having a dropdown menu with available cities could be helpful. A resource to consider is W3School, specifically <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_dropdown.asp">this link.</a><BR><BR>

Users must enter all lowercase letters, resulting in inaccurate results. For instance, a search for "CA" or "California" will result in a blank search. <BR>
<strong>Recommendation:</strong> Adding toUpperCase() or toLowerCase() can solve this issue. Reference <a href="https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/compare-strings-ignore-case">this website</a> for instructions.<BR><BR>
 

 #### <ins>Further Development</ins>
 
The data can be cleaned up for consistency. The search results above have time marked in several ways, including "6 minutes", "15 min.", and "noticed from dusk to dawn". <BR>

The addition of a clear filter button would make searching much easier and more user-friendly. At the moment a filed must be deleted in order to clear it, a clear filter button would look nice and make navigation far more
